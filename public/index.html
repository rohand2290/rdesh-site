I&rsquo;m Rohan Deshpande, a current student at UCLA studying Computational and Systems Biology.
Since the UCLA LUG was gracious enough to give me a server, I figured it was about time that I started my own website instead of relying on other platforms.
This website is a way where I can document my time in college through articles, as well as explaining some stuff.
I want to host more stuff here in the future, such as my in-progress personal knowledge management system, but this can serve as a hub.">

<h2 id="interests">Interests</h2>
<p>Some of my interests include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Biology</li>
<li>Chemistry</li>
<li>Medicine</li>
<li>Computer Science</li>
<li>Math</li>
<li>History</li>
<li>Geopolitics</li>
</ul>
<p>Very spread out.
The history and geopolitics is more of a hobby, but I am interested in getting involved in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_biology">systems biology</a> research and using computers to create models of biological processes.
I&rsquo;d appreciate any guidance involving this, or once I get into a lab and spend some time there I&rsquo;ll write an article.</p>
