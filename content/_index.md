# About me
I'm Rohan Deshpande, a current student at UCLA studying [Computational and Systems Biology](https://casb.ucla.edu/).
Since the UCLA LUG was gracious enough to give me a server, I figured it was about time that I started my own website instead of relying on other platforms.

This website is a way where I can document my time in college through articles, as well as explaining some stuff.
I want to host more stuff here in the future, such as my in-progress personal knowledge management system, but this can serve as a hub.



## Interests
Some of my interests include:
* Biology
* Chemistry
* Medicine
* Computer Science
* Math
* History
* Geopolitics

Very spread out. 
The history and geopolitics is more of a hobby, but I am interested in getting involved in [systems biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_biology) research and using computers to create models of biological processes.
I'd appreciate any guidance involving this, or once I get into a lab and spend some time there I'll write an article.
